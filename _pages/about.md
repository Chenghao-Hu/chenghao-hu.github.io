Luckily, I have been on the journey to a linguist(syntactician) since 2017.

After obtaining my Bachelor's Degree (in Linguistics and Language Application) at The City University of Hong Kong and my Master's Degree (in Linguistics) at University College London, I am currently working towards my Doctoral degree in Linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, starting in 2023. 

I am now part of Prof. Victor Pan's Syntax Lab. Meet my lovely group members [here](https://victorjunnanpan.github.io/pansyntaxlab/).

Research
------
As years went by, I still found myself obsessed with Chinese syntax under the framework of generative grammar. Despite numerous topics I would like to touch upon, here are several of my current research interests.

- The status of complex Merges (e.g., Sideward Movement) in the modal of Syntax
- Labeling and Anti-labeling
- Nominal licensing mechanisms
- Syntax-Phonology interface
